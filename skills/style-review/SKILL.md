name: style-review
description: Audit your style files for contradictions, stale rules, uncommitted patterns. Auto-fires on "/style-review", "audit my style guide", "is my style guide healthy", "check my voice rules", or any phrase about reviewing the style files. Read-only by default; produces a report you can action.

See `commands/style-review.md` for the full audit workflow.

## When this skill fires

- User runs `/style-review` directly
- User says: "audit my style guide", "check my style files", "is my voice consistent"
- A scheduled task triggers this (common pattern: monthly)

## What this skill is NOT for

- Active style enforcement. The audit produces recommendations; doesn't auto-fix.
- Drafting. Use `/style` for that.
- Bulk style file rewrites. The audit suggests changes one at a time.
